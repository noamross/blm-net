We value dialogue and relationship building between and among Black people.

We need to have a million white people Black Lives Matter march. We aren't going to ask any black or brown person to do one single thing. This is OUR work. We WILL get up off our liberal white behinds and do this thing. We will.

Let's get organized.

NOTE: This will not be a space to bicker for any reason. This is a constructive and safe space and trolling will NOT be tolerated.

*UPDATE - this group has evolved in the months since it's inception. There is some critical reading that I would like to encourage everyone who joins this group to read. 

1) 4 Ways White People Can Process Their Emotions Without Bringing the White Tears.

2) Dear white progressives: Stop telling black people how to vote
http://www.salon.com/2015/07/21/dear_white_progressives_stop_telling_black_people_how_to_vote/
With primary election season upon us, the number of people who have joined this group to promote a political agenda, despite gentle, private caution, is ridiculous. 

The Black Lives Movement has chosen not to endorse any candidates. We, as anti-racists who support the BLM movement and seek to dismantle racism, are not hear to tell anyone who they should vote for. POC are intelligent enough to make educated decisions for themselves and we will not perpetuate the patriarchy here by telling them who to vote for. If you have evidence-based articles that support critical issues in the black and brown communities related to candidates, it is fair to share them. However, this is NOT a place to pander; IMHO, it is tantamount to trolling. We WILL respect the BLM movement, and anyone who chooses not to agree to that social contract with be removed.

This has never been a space without growth tension and new ideas - however it has been respectful, intellectual and a sacred space. There is no room for patriarchal, white supremacist agendas.","April 14, 2017","2,350 Members",2758 Members,1,yes and active,NA,NA,NA

This movement is centered on the issue of Black Lives being murdered and abused with impunity. This movement DEMANDS that justice be served to those guilty of murder or abuse of Blacks, just as any other people. We DEMAND that law enforcement be charged and prosecuted for crimes against citizens just as citizens are charged for crimes against law enforcement.
The term “Black Lives Matter“ was coined as a result of the murderer of Trayvon Martin being set free, thereby reinforcing the reality that Black Lives in America are too often seen as valueless. The phrase and hashtag organically evolved into a movement as a result of the numerous cases of police murders with impunity (no consequences) of unarmed Black people around the Nation. 
A diverse group of local Black Lives Matter supporters organize protest within their perspective cities in solidarity with the International movement, as well as for protest centered on local issues, for the purposes of, but not limited to:

WHAT WE WANT
-An immediate end to police murders of Black people, as well as an immediate end Police violence and misconduct against Blacks people.

-We want all Police equipped with mandatory body cameras that must be on during all encounters with citizens.
-We want all police involved killings and complaints of misconduct investigated independent of the Police department and with total transparency. 
-We want an end to the mass incarceration and extortion of Black people thru systematic racism and practices.
-We want an immediate end to; racial profiling; the labeling of predominately Black occupied communities as “crime/drug areas”; and the practice of criminalizing Black people by setting up road blocks in predominately Black occupied communities. 
-We want an immediate end to the use of our municipal courts system as extortion rings in the form of grossly high court cost, fines, and other fees.
-We want the 1901 Alabama Constitution that was created to establish white supremacy by law replaced with a new Constitution.

-We want an end to violence and crime in our communities, and we are organizing and developing communities in order to help bring that into reality.
-We want to organize our communities around the concept of an “Village”. 
-We want to set up mentoring programs (civilization classes), buyer clubs/co-op businesses, conflict resolution committees, and community parenting advisory boards, to usher in both a new mentality of self-reliance and dignity amongst our people and job and ownership opportunities for ourselves.

Mission
Our mission is to organize Black people to Love one another, to know and stand up for their rights, to protect themselves against all injustice and abuse, and to set businesses so as to become a self-sufficient people who are a benefit to ourselves.","April 17, 2017","8,857 Likes",NA,NA,NA,NA,blacklivesmatterbirmingham@gmail.com,Call (708) 666-6666

Marcia,NA,Facebook Pages,Black Lives Matter Denmark,@BlackLivesMatterDenmark,Denmark,"September 25, 2016",unclear,"BLM Denmark is a platform from which to actively address and protest minority racism against people of color by the police and justice system. 
The active focus will mainly be for Denmark and Northern Europe while also updating with relevant news an international level. 

BLM Denmark will mainly address L67 law resulting in the Guantamamo - Concentration Camp type jailings of non-criminal innocent asylum seekers and immigrants rotting in jails for months on end. There has been no attention paid and no organised protest so the authorities have become negligent with minoritys right to freedom. 
These jailings are getting longer and longer resulting in suicide attempts and hunger strikes. We appreciate them not gassing the inmates to death and not forcing them in labour but that is where the difference stops. 
Normal right and privileges granted to the Danish criminal prison population are denied jailed asylum seekers, transit refugees and immigrants. 

Besides that issues regarding the kriminelle justice system will be addressed on this platform. 
This is right from the Ryan Lochte and ""Asyl spray"" type #TheBlackGuyDidItSyndrome to ever growing unfair huge gap between the length of sentences criminal justice system doles out to people of color and White people. This combined with not being able to afford good legal representation affects the statistics reinforcing the myth and prejuidice that men of color are dangerous and more criminal.

The assumption of guilt begins with the Police on street level where there is an ever growing tendency for a racially mixed groups of friends from the age of adolescence up to be approached by Police and only the minorities have to show their iD. 
- There is a greater ratio of arrests
- There is a longer and higher rate of convictions needs to be researched on a scientific level and debated.
- White convicted seem to receive more ""fodlænker"" sentences

If you are a minority Dane and would like to assist in the engine room, you are more than welcome to send a message. I took the initiative but I humbly admit one person cannot carry this project alone. I need the communities support in a combined and common effort. 

Black Lives Matter Denmark is intersectional and addresses Black and Brown race minority issues.

We are looking to establish a coalition with like-minded organizations in order to liberate the underrepresented communities in Northern Nevada with an emphasis on the Black population. We do not condone or promote violence of any kind. We are an inclusive, collaborative group that will host meetings and forums to discuss effective ways to tackle issues within our community. These issues include but are not limited to, restorative justice, improvement of community/police relations, increasing graduation rates, reducing Black-on-Black crime, and media bias when covering minority issues. We are a forum that gives the community a platform to voice their testimonies and expectations in solidarity to ultimately put an end to systemic and targeted racism. 

Black Lives Matter is an activist movement that campaigns against violence towards black people. The movement was co-founded in 2013 by three black community organizers: Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi. BLM regularly organizes protests around the deaths of black people in killings by law enforcement officers, and broader issues of racial profiling, police brutality, and racial inequality in the United States criminal justice system.

We seek to, through a variety of outlets and resources, empower communities through education and action. Black Lives Matter is an ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise. When we say Black Lives Matter, we are broadening the conversation around state violence to include all of the ways in which Black people are intentionally left powerless at the hands of the state. The Black Lives Matter network, affirms the lives of Black queer and trans folks, disabled folks, Black-undocumented folks, folks with records, women and all Black lives along the gender spectrum. It centers those that have been marginalized within Black liberation movements. We are committed to boldly challenging state-sanctioned violence in this city and county every day, whether that comes in the form of rising rents and homelessness, low wages and poverty, mass incarceration or a police officer’s bullet. Our chapter stands against the displacement of people of color, the poor, and other oppressed folks in the city of Sacramento by politicians and business owners who prioritize profit over the basic rights, health and dignity of residents. We will continue to fight for Black folks – whether they be African, Caribbean, African American, Afro-Latinx, Afro-Asian, etc. – who are enduring state-sanctioned violence in the form of the denial of basic human rights, police brutality, and discriminatory policies that unfairly target communities of color. Lastly, we seek to push for unity in communities that are also seeking equality, for we understand that People Power is one of the most powerful tools of all to combat injustice.",4/16/2017,"12,661 Likes

Marcia,NA,Facebook Pages,Black Lives Matter: NYC,@BlackLivesMatterNYC,New York City,2012,chapter of the #Blacklivesmatter movement,"#BlackLivesMatter was created in 2012 after Trayvon Martin’s murderer, George Zimmerman, was acquitted for his crime, and dead 17-year old Trayvon was post-humously placed on trial for his own murder. Rooted in the experiences of Black people in this country who actively resist our de-humanization, #BlackLivesMatter is a call to action and a response to the virulent anti-Black racism that permeates our society.Black Lives Matter is a unique contribution that goes beyond extrajudicial killings of Black people by police and vigilantes. 

It goes beyond the narrow nationalism that can be prevalent within Black communities, which merely call on Black people to love Black, live Black and buy Black, keeping straight cis Black men in the front of the movement while our sisters, queer and trans and disabled folk take up roles in the background or not at all. Black Lives Matter affirms the lives of Black queer and trans folks, disabled folks, black-undocumented folks, folks with records, women and all Black lives along the gender spectrum. It centers those that have been marginalized within Black liberation movements. It is a tactic to (re)build the Black liberation movement.

When we say Black Lives Matter, we are broadening the conversation around state violence to include all of the ways in which Black people are intentionally left powerless at the hands of the state. We are talking about the ways in which Black lives are deprived of our basic human rights and dignity. How Black poverty and genocide is state violence. How 2.8 million Black people are locked in cages in this country is state violence. How Black women bearing the burden of a relentless assault on our children and our families is state violence. How Black queer and trans folks bear a unique burden from a hetero-patriarchal society that disposes of us like garbage and simultaneously fetishizes us and profits off of us, and that is state violence. How 500,000 Black people in the US are undocumented immigrants and relegated to the shadows. How Black girls are used as negotiating chips during times of conflict and war. How Black folks living with disabilities and different abilities bear the burden of state sponsored Darwinian experiments that attempt to squeeze us into boxes of normality defined by white supremacy, and that is state violence.

#BlackLivesMatter is working for a world where Black lives are no longer systematically and intentionally targeted for demise. We affirm our contributions to this society, our humanity, and our resilience in the face of deadly oppression. We have put our sweat equity and love for Black people into creating a political project–taking the hashtag off of social media and into the streets.

http://www.blacklivesmattersyllabus.com/summersyllabus/

There are a couple of newer (2016) ideas, so if you've read or seen most of the resources, there'd be something new for you in here, too.

I'm offering to take a coordinating role in terms of collecting names and contacts of interested people, and helping to sort out a schedule that is realistic and would work for as many as possible (I'm thinking meetings could be 1x/ week, 1x/ month, or 1x/ per resource... )

Once interested parties are together, we can collectively decide what we read, and the format of our group discussions, etc.

The hope is that by staying informed and educated, we can be better equipped to tackle the monster of racism. It's a small step in that direction, but a step that is essential.","April 17, 2017",23 Members,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
